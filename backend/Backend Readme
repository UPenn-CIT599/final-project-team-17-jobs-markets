The backend data portion of this project contains three Java files and one test file.
Follow the below steps to generate the "JobPostingData.csv" file that can be later used for the API Service.

Step 1. Go to https://github.com/UPenn-CIT599/final-project-team-17-jobs-markets/tree/master/backend folder.
Step 2. Open Eclipse IDE, create a new project called "Backend"
Step 3. In the Step 1 link, copy and paste all files in the "src" folder to the "src" folder in the "Backend" project.
Copy and paste "JobPostingData.html" directly under "Backend" project.
Step 4. Download all files ending with ".jar" in the "lib" folder of the Step 1 link to a local directory.
Step 5. In Eclipse, right click "Backend" -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path. In the "Library" tab, click "Add External JARs", and import all the ".jar" files downloaded in Step 4. Hit "Apply and Close."
Step 6. Open the "JobPostingDataSourcing.java" file, hit run.
