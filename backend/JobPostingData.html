<p>Look at the "Training" dataset where human trainers wrote that the combination of Row #2 from the "Meta-Data" dataset and the Row #2950 from the "Meta-Data" dataset have a lot in common, and human-labelled the combination a "5" on a 1 to 5 similarity scale. This is the value we're trying to predict. The size of the training data is small (low thousands), but can be increased if needed;</p>
<p>Use the Training dataset to train your own model that predicts the value on a scale of 1 to 5;</p>
