CIT 591 Final Project - Team 17 - Job Markets

[Overview]

Core problems this application aims to address is being one stop to access jobs information in the markets. 
In the project, we mean to “demonstrate” that we could use what we’ve learnt to create an application with proper architecture to achieve this purpose. 

This DOESN’T mean to build a commercial ready product. 


[Architecture]

We are trying to use the JAVA knowledge we’ve learned from the course and beyond to build this application. 
The application includes multiple layers that a classic modern application would have. 

1. Data Fetcher:  a crawler to fetch jobs data from external data sources. Written by JAVA. 
2. ETL:  a component to Extract, Transform, and Load clean data into file. Written by JAVA. 
3. Jobs Data: use files as storage to store clean job data prepared by the ETL component. 
4. API Service: a set of restful APIs to provide client application access to jobs data. Written by JAVA. 
5. User Interface: an interface user can interact to see top demanding skills and jobs recommendation.
